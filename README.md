# RE-Miner Dashboard

The **RE-Miner Dashboard** is a core component of **RE-Miner 2.0**, part of the broader **RE-Miner Ecosystem**. 

It provides an intuitive UI for users to interact with the RE-Miner 2.0 backend for data analysis, visualization, and NLP-based insights.

## RE-Miner 2.0 Architecture

The structure of **RE-Miner 2.0** is illustrated in the diagram below:

## 🛠 Dependencies
The frontend requires the following dependencies to function properly:

- 🔗 **[RE-Miner Dashboard BFF (Backend for Frontend)](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Dashboard-BFF)** – An intermediary layer for API communication.
- 🔗 **[MApp-KG](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/app_data_repository)** – An RDF-based knowledge graph that integrates a catalog of mobile applications and user reviews.
- 🔗 **[RE-Miner HUB](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Hub)** – The central integration point connecting the core layer with the outer layers. It facilitates communication within the RE-Miner 2.0 ecosystem and is essential for performing all RE-Miner 2.0 tasks.
- **SQL Database** – Stores structured data (e.g., user information).

⚠ **Note:** To install and execute all dependencies at once, you can use the **[RE-Miner Orchestrator](https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Orchestrator)**.
